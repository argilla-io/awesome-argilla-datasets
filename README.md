# Awesome Argilla Datasets

The Argilla team periodically creates datasets and loves to share the process and data with the world.

By doing this, we hope to:

- help others get started with Argilla
- provide a source of inspiration for new datasets and annotation tasks
- share our data, models, and learnings and best practices
- inspire others to create their own datasets and share them with the world
- get personal experience with the Argilla annotation process

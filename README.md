# Awesome Argilla Datasets

The Argilla team periodically creates datasets and loves to share the process and data with the world.

## Why?

We hope to:

- *Help* others get started with Argilla
- *Inspire* the community for setting up their own annotation projects
- *Share* our data, models, and learnings and best practices
- *Experience* the Argilla annotation process hands-on
